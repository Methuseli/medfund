# Portals & Roles

## Overview

MedFund v2 has five distinct portal experiences, each serving a different audience. The Angular web application hosts four of these as route groups (super admin, tenant admin, operations, provider). The Flutter application serves two audiences (members and providers) on both mobile and web.

---

## 5. Group Liaison Portal (Flutter Mobile + Web)

**Audience**: Corporate/employer group account managers (HR officers, company administrators) who manage their organization's medical aid membership.

**Keycloak Realm**: `tenant-{slug}`

**Role**: `group_liaison` (assigned **in addition to** `member` role)

**Important**: Group liaisons are themselves members of the medical aid. They have a dual role — as a `member` they can see their own benefits, claims, and medical data. As a `group_liaison` they can manage the group's members and billing but **NEVER** see other members' medical/claims data. The Flutter app provides a **role switcher** to toggle between "My Account" (member view) and "Group Management" (liaison view).

**Key constraint**: The `group_liaison` permission set grants access to member admin and billing but **NEVER** to medical/claims data (PHI) of other members. This is enforced at the API level — the Claims Service rejects all requests made in group_liaison context for other members' data.

### What Group Liaisons CAN See

| Data | Access | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Group profile and settings | Read/Write | They manage the corporate account |
| Member list (names, ID numbers, scheme, status, dependants) | Read/Write | They enroll and manage members |
| Dependant list per member (names, relationship, age) | Read/Write | They manage dependants for the group |
| Group contribution invoices and billing history | Read | They are responsible for paying the bill |
| Group balance (outstanding, overpaid) | Read | They need to know what they owe |
| Payment history (contribution payments made) | Read | Track what they've paid |
| Member contribution breakdown (how much per member) | Read | Understand the bill composition |
| Scheme details and pricing | Read | Know what plans are available for their employees |

### What Group Liaisons CANNOT See

| Data | Access | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| Claims (any claim data) | **BLOCKED** | Medical privacy — PHI |
| Adjudication details | **BLOCKED** | Medical privacy |
| Diagnosis codes, tariff codes | **BLOCKED** | Medical privacy |
| Member benefit balances (usage) | **BLOCKED** | Reveals medical utilization |
| Pre-authorizations | **BLOCKED** | Medical privacy |
| Provider visit history | **BLOCKED** | Medical privacy |
| Chat messages | **BLOCKED** | Private member communications |

### Flutter Role Switcher

Since group liaisons are also members, the Flutter app shows a **role switcher** in the app header/drawer:

```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│  ☰  MedFund                │
│                            │
│  ┌──────────────────────┐  │
│  │ 👤 John Doe          │  │
│  │                      │  │
│  │ ○ My Account         │  │  ← Member view (benefits, claims, payments)
│  │ ● Group Management   │  │  ← Liaison view (members, billing, enrollment)
│  │                      │  │
│  │ ACME Corp            │  │
│  └──────────────────────┘  │
│                            │
│  [Dashboard]               │  ← Changes based on active role
│  [Members]                 │
│  [Bills]                   │
│  ...                       │
└────────────────────────────┘
```

- **"My Account"** mode: Shows the standard member portal (dashboard, benefits, claims, payments, profile, chat, digital card)
- **"Group Management"** mode: Shows the group liaison portal (group dashboard, members, bills, payments, enrollment)
- The active mode determines which API context is used — member requests use the user's member_id, group requests use the group_id
- If a user is a liaison for multiple groups (rare), a group selector appears under Group Management

### Screens (Group Management Mode)

| Screen | Features |
|--------|----------|
| **Dashboard** | Group summary: total members, active/suspended count, outstanding balance, next billing date |
| **Members** | Full member list with search/filter. Status (active, suspended, terminated). View member details (personal info, scheme, dependants — no medical data) |
| **Add Member** | Enroll new employee: personal details, scheme selection, dependants, effective date |
| **Edit Member** | Update member details, add/remove dependants, request scheme change |
| **Terminate Member** | Terminate a member (with effective date, e.g., employee left the company) |
| **Suspend/Reinstate** | Suspend a member (e.g., unpaid leave) or reinstate a suspended member |
| **Bills** | View group contribution invoices, breakdown per member, download invoice PDF |
| **Pay Bill** | Pay outstanding invoice via EcoCash, card, bank transfer (Payment Gateway) |
| **Payment History** | Past payments with receipts, payment method, date |
| **Auto-Pay** | Set up recurring contribution payments for the group |
| **Schemes** | View available schemes and pricing, request scheme changes for members |
| **Reports** | Group membership report (headcount by scheme, age group, status), billing summary |
| **Profile** | Group details (company name, address, banking details), liaison contact info |
| **Notifications** | Billing reminders, payment confirmations, member enrollment confirmations |

### API Enforcement

The permission model ensures data isolation at the service level:

```
group_liaison role permissions:
  members:read, members:create, members:update, members:suspend, members:terminate
  dependants:read, dependants:create, dependants:update, dependants:remove
  groups:read, groups:update (own group only)
  contributions:read (own group only)
  invoices:read (own group only)
  transactions:read (own group only)
  schemes:read
  payments:create (own group invoices only)

  # Explicitly DENIED (not just missing — actively rejected with 403):
  claims:* — DENIED
  adjudications:* — DENIED
  pre_authorizations:* — DENIED
  benefit_balances:* — DENIED
  audit:* — DENIED (except own group member enrollment actions)
```

The Claims Service, Finance Service (claim-related endpoints), and AI Service validate the caller's role and return `403 Forbidden` if a `group_liaison` attempts to access any medical data.

## 6. Member Portal (Flutter Mobile + Web)

**Audience**: Insurance members (corporate employees AND individual subscribers) and their dependants.

**Keycloak Realm**: `tenant-{slug}` (same realm as tenant staff, different role)

**Role**: `member`

### Membership Models

The member experience differs based on the tenant's `membership_model` setting:

| Feature | Group/Corporate Member | Individual Member |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Enrollment** | Enrolled by group liaison or HR via admin portal | Self-registers via Flutter app or public signup page |
| **Scheme selection** | Assigned by employer group | Chooses own scheme during registration |
| **Contribution billing** | Billed to employer group (payroll deduction) | Billed directly to individual (pays via app) |
| **Payment** | Group pays on behalf (member sees bills but doesn't pay) | Pays directly via EcoCash, card, bank transfer |
| **Group admin features** | No access to group management | N/A — no group |
| **Scheme changes** | Requested, approved by group liaison | Self-service (subject to waiting periods) |
| **Dependant management** | May require group liaison approval | Self-service |

### Individual Self-Registration Flow

### Permission Model (Granular RBAC with Custom Roles)

The platform uses a **fine-grained permission system** where tenant admins can create custom roles that grant access to specific portal sections with explicit read or write access. A single user can be assigned multiple roles, giving them cross-portal access as needed.

#### Permission Structure

Every permission follows the format: `{portal_section}:{action}`

Actions are:
- `read` — View data (read-only access to the section)
- `write` — Create and update data
- `delete` — Remove/terminate/suspend records
- `approve` — Authorize actions (adjudication decisions, payment run approvals, etc.)
- `export` — Download reports, PDFs, CSVs
- `configure` — Change settings, rules, configuration

#### Custom Role Builder

Tenant admins create custom roles via **`/admin/roles`** in the Angular web app:

```

#### Default Roles (Seeded per Tenant)

These are pre-configured when a tenant is provisioned. Tenant admins can modify them or create new ones.

| Default Role | Portal Access | Permissions Summary |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| `tenant_admin` | All portals | Full read/write/approve/configure on everything |
| `claims_clerk` | Claims | Read + approve on claims queue, read on submissions, pre-auth, tariffs |
| `claims_supervisor` | Claims | Everything `claims_clerk` has + override AI, manage tariffs, manage rejections |
| `finance_clerk` | Finance | Read on all finance sections, write on payments and adjustments |
| `finance_hod` | Finance | Everything `finance_clerk` has + approve payment runs, approve payouts |
| `finance_supervisor` | Finance + Claims (read-only) | Full finance access + read-only claims view (to verify before payment) |
| `contributions_clerk` | Contributions | Read/write on billing, members, groups, transactions, invoices |
| `contributions_supervisor` | Contributions + Finance (read-only) | Full contributions access + read-only finance payments view |
| `operations_manager` | Claims + Finance + Contributions (read-only) | Read + export across all operational portals, no write access |
| `auditor` | All portals (read-only) + Audit | Read-only on everything + full audit log access + export |

#### Assigning Roles to Users

A user can have **multiple roles**. Their effective permissions are the **union** of all assigned roles.

Example: A user assigned both `claims_clerk` and `finance_clerk` roles can:
- Access the Claims portal (adjudicate claims)
- Access the Finance portal (record payments)
- See both portals in their navigation sidebar

The Angular app dynamically shows/hides navigation items and portal sections based on the user's effective permissions.

#### Database Schema

```sql
-- Custom roles (per-tenant schema)
CREATE TABLE roles (
    id              UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name            VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description     TEXT,
    is_system       BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,  -- true for default seeded roles (can be modified but not deleted)
    is_active       BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_by      UUID NOT NULL,
    updated_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_by      UUID NOT NULL,

    UNIQUE(name)
);

-- Permission assignments per role
CREATE TABLE role_permissions (
    id              UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    role_id         UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES roles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    permission      VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,   -- 'claims.queue:read', 'finance.payments:approve', etc.

    UNIQUE(role_id, permission)
);

-- User-role assignments (many-to-many)
CREATE TABLE user_roles (
    id              UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id         UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    role_id         UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES roles(id),
    assigned_at     TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    assigned_by     UUID NOT NULL,

    UNIQUE(user_id, role_id)
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_role_permissions_role ON role_permissions(role_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_roles_user ON user_roles(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_roles_role ON user_roles(role_id);
```

#### How Permissions Are Enforced

**1. JWT Token** — When a user logs in, Keycloak includes their effective permissions in the token (via a custom protocol mapper that queries the role/permission tables):

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "claims.queue:read",
    "claims.submissions:read",
    "claims.reports:read",
    "claims.reports:export",
    "finance.dashboard:read",
    "finance.payments:read",
    "finance.reports:read",
    "finance.reports:export"
  ]
}
```

**2. API Gateway (Go)** — Checks the permission claim against the requested endpoint before forwarding:

```go
// Permission middleware — maps routes to required permissions
var routePermissions = map[string]string{
    "GET /api/v2/claims/queue":           "claims.queue:read",
    "POST /api/v2/claims/:id/adjudicate": "claims.queue:approve",
    "GET /api/v2/finance/payments":       "finance.payments:read",
    "POST /api/v2/finance/payment-runs":  "finance.payment_runs:write",
    // ...
}

func PermissionMiddleware() fiber.Handler {
    return func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
        requiredPerm := matchRoutePermission(c.Method(), c.Path())
        if requiredPerm == "" {
            return c.Next() // No permission required (public endpoint)
        }
        userPerms := c.Locals("permissions").([]string)
        if !contains(userPerms, requiredPerm) {
            return c.Status(403).JSON(ProblemDetail{
                Type:   "forbidden",
                Title:  "Insufficient permissions",
                Detail: "Required: " + requiredPerm,
            })
        }
        return c.Next()
    }
}
```

**3. Angular Frontend** — Dynamically renders navigation and UI based on permissions:

```typescript
// PermissionService — checks user's effective permissions
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class PermissionService {
  private permissions = signal<Set<string>>(new Set());

  has(permission: string): boolean {
    return this.permissions().has(permission);
  }

  hasAny(...permissions: string[]): boolean {
    return permissions.some(p => this.permissions().has(p));
  }

  // Check if user has any permission in a portal section
  canAccessPortal(portal: 'claims' | 'finance' | 'contributions' | 'admin'): boolean {
    return [...this.permissions()].some(p => p.startsWith(portal + '.'));
  }
}

// Navigation — only shows portals the user can access
@Component({ selector: 'app-sidebar' })
export class SidebarComponent {
  showClaims = computed(() => this.perms.canAccessPortal('claims'));
  showFinance = computed(() => this.perms.canAccessPortal('finance'));
  showContributions = computed(() => this.perms.canAccessPortal('contributions'));
  showAdmin = computed(() => this.perms.canAccessPortal('admin'));
}

// Route guard — protects routes by permission
export const claimsGuard: CanActivateFn = () => {
  return inject(PermissionService).canAccessPortal('claims');
};

// In-template usage — show/hide buttons based on write/approve access
<button *ngIf="perms.has('claims.queue:approve')" (click)="adjudicate()">
  Approve Claim
</button>
<!-- Read-only users see the data but no action buttons -->
```

**4. Read-Only Enforcement** — When a user has `read` but not `write`/`approve` for a section:
- API returns `403` on POST/PATCH/DELETE requests
- Angular hides action buttons (create, edit, approve, delete)
- Form fields are displayed as read-only text instead of editable inputs
- Export buttons only appear if `export` permission is present

## Tenant Branding & UI Customization

Tenant admins can customize the look and feel of their **Angular web portals** (admin, claims, finance, contributions, provider portal). The **Flutter member and provider mobile apps remain generic** with MedFund branding — only the logo and color scheme adapt per tenant.

### What is Customizable (Angular Web — Tenant Portals)

| Category | Setting | Description | Default |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Identity** | Logo (light) | Primary logo for light backgrounds | MedFund logo |
| | Logo (dark) | Logo variant for dark backgrounds/sidebar | MedFund logo |
| | Favicon | Browser tab icon | MedFund favicon |
| | Organization name | Displayed in header, footer, PDF reports | Tenant name |
| **Colors** | Primary color | Buttons, links, active states, selection highlights | `#1677ff` |
| | Secondary color | Accents, badges, secondary actions | `#52c41a` |
| | Sidebar background | Side navigation background color | `#001529` |
| | Sidebar text color | Side navigation text and icon color | `#ffffff` |
| | Header background | Top header bar color | `#ffffff` |
| | Success / Warning / Error | Semantic feedback colors | Standard green/amber/red |
| **Layout** | Sidebar style | `collapsed` (icon-only), `expanded` (icon + text), `hidden` (top nav only) | `expanded` |
| | Layout mode | `sidebar` (side nav + content) or `topnav` (horizontal nav + content) | `sidebar` |
| | Content width | `fluid` (full width) or `fixed` (max-width centered) | `fluid` |
| | Sidebar position | `left` or `right` | `left` |
| | Theme mode | `light`, `dark`, or `system` (follows OS preference) | `light` |
| | Compact mode | Reduces padding/spacing for information-dense screens | `false` |
| **Typography** | Font family | Primary font for UI text | `Inter` |
| | Heading font | Font for headings (h1-h6) — can differ from body | Same as body |
| **Login Page** | Background image | Login/signup page background | MedFund default |
| | Welcome message | Text displayed on login page | "Welcome to {org_name}" |
| **PDF Reports** | Letterhead image | Top of invoices, payment advice, statements | Tenant logo |
| | Footer text | Bottom of PDF documents | Tenant name + address |
| **Email** | Header logo | Logo in email notification header | Tenant logo |
| | Footer text | Email footer (address, contact info, legal) | Tenant defaults |
| **Custom Domain** | Domain | `portal.zmmas.co.zw` instead of `zmmas.medfund.healthcare` | `{slug}.medfund.healthcare` |

### What is NOT Customizable

- Page structure, navigation items, component behavior — these are platform-defined
- Flutter mobile/web app UI layout — remains generic MedFund design (only logo + colors adapt)
- Super admin portal — always uses MedFund platform branding

### Branding Configuration Schema

```sql
-- Per-tenant branding (in tenant schema)
CREATE TABLE branding_config (
    id              UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    -- Identity
    logo_light_url  TEXT,               -- S3 URL for light background logo
    logo_dark_url   TEXT,               -- S3 URL for dark background logo
    favicon_url     TEXT,               -- S3 URL for favicon
    org_display_name VARCHAR(200),      -- Override display name

    -- Colors (stored as hex)
    color_primary       VARCHAR(7),     -- '#1677ff'
    color_secondary     VARCHAR(7),
    color_sidebar_bg    VARCHAR(7),
    color_sidebar_text  VARCHAR(7),
    color_header_bg     VARCHAR(7),
    color_success       VARCHAR(7),
    color_warning       VARCHAR(7),
    color_error         VARCHAR(7),

    -- Layout
    layout_mode         VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'sidebar',    -- 'sidebar', 'topnav'
    sidebar_style       VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'expanded',   -- 'collapsed', 'expanded', 'hidden'
    sidebar_position    VARCHAR(5) DEFAULT 'left',        -- 'left', 'right'
    content_width       VARCHAR(5) DEFAULT 'fluid',       -- 'fluid', 'fixed'
    theme_mode          VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'light',      -- 'light', 'dark', 'system'
    compact_mode        BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,

    -- Typography
    font_family         VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'Inter',
    heading_font_family VARCHAR(100),                     -- NULL = same as font_family

    -- Login
    login_bg_image_url  TEXT,
    login_welcome_text  TEXT,

    -- PDF
    pdf_letterhead_url  TEXT,
    pdf_footer_text     TEXT,

    -- Email
    email_header_logo_url TEXT,
    email_footer_text   TEXT,

    updated_at          TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_by          UUID NOT NULL
);
```

### How Branding is Applied

#### Angular Web App

Branding is loaded on app initialization and applied via CSS custom properties (variables):

```typescript
// BrandingService — loads tenant branding from API on app init
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class BrandingService {
  private config = signal<BrandingConfig | null>(null);

  async loadBranding(): Promise<void> {
    const branding = await firstValueFrom(
      this.http.get<BrandingConfig>('/api/v2/tenancy/branding')
    );
    this.config.set(branding);
    this.applyToDOM(branding);
  }

  private applyToDOM(config: BrandingConfig): void {
    const root = document.documentElement;

    // Colors → CSS custom properties
    if (config.colorPrimary)
      root.style.setProperty('--color-primary', config.colorPrimary);
    if (config.colorSecondary)
      root.style.setProperty('--color-secondary', config.colorSecondary);
    if (config.colorSidebarBg)
      root.style.setProperty('--color-sidebar-bg', config.colorSidebarBg);
    // ... all color variables

    // Typography
    if (config.fontFamily)
      root.style.setProperty('--font-family', config.fontFamily);

    // Theme mode
    if (config.themeMode === 'dark')
      document.body.classList.add('dark');
    else if (config.themeMode === 'system')
      this.applySystemTheme();

    // Favicon
    if (config.faviconUrl)
      (document.querySelector('link[rel="icon"]') as HTMLLinkElement).href = config.faviconUrl;

    // Document title
    if (config.orgDisplayName)
      document.title = config.orgDisplayName;
  }
}
```

Components reference these variables via Tailwind or direct CSS:

```css
/* tailwind.config.js extends theme with CSS variables */
:root {
  --color-primary: #1677ff;
  --color-secondary: #52c41a;
  --color-sidebar-bg: #001529;
  --color-sidebar-text: #ffffff;
  --color-header-bg: #ffffff;
  --font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}

/* Components use the variables */
.btn-primary { background-color: var(--color-primary); }
.sidebar { background-color: var(--color-sidebar-bg); color: var(--color-sidebar-text); }
```

Layout mode is applied via a top-level component class:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<div [class]="layoutClass()">
  <app-sidebar *ngIf="branding.layoutMode() === 'sidebar'" />
  <app-topnav *ngIf="branding.layoutMode() === 'topnav'" />
  <main [class.max-w-7xl]="branding.contentWidth() === 'fixed'"
        [class.compact]="branding.compactMode()">
    <router-outlet />
  </main>
</div>
```

#### Flutter Mobile/Web App (Limited)

Flutter adapts only logo and primary/secondary colors — layout remains standard MedFund:

```dart
// ThemeService loads tenant branding for color adaptation
class TenantTheme {
  final Color primaryColor;
  final Color secondaryColor;
  final String? logoUrl;

  ThemeData toThemeData() {
    return ThemeData(
      colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: primaryColor),
      // Layout, typography, component styles remain MedFund standard
    );
  }
}
```

### Tenant Admin Branding UI

**Route**: `/admin/settings/branding`

| Section | Controls |
|---------|----------|
| **Identity** | Logo upload (drag-and-drop, crop/resize preview), favicon upload, display name |
| **Colors** | Color picker for each configurable color, with live preview panel |
| **Layout** | Radio buttons for layout mode, sidebar style, content width. Toggle for compact mode |
| **Typography** | Font selector (dropdown of web-safe + Google Fonts) |
| **Theme** | Light/dark/system toggle with preview |
| **Login Page** | Background image upload, welcome text editor |
| **PDF & Email** | Letterhead upload, footer text editor, email preview |
| **Preview** | Full-page live preview showing how the portal will look with current settings |
| **Reset** | Reset all to MedFund defaults |

Changes are saved and applied immediately (no deploy needed) — the Angular app fetches branding config on every page load (cached in Redis, ~50ms overhead).
